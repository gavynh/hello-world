Getting familar with github, starting it out right with a "Hello World" project.


Hello World!

My name is Gavyn, I'm a student and I'm still learning how to program but excited for what it has to offer. I've currently only used C# to write code, but we have used ASP.NET and Bootstrap within our classes. 
Thanks for reading!
